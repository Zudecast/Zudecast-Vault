		{"type":"text","text":"# Definitions\n- Commodity Currency\n> Commodity money is¬†**money whose value comes from a commodity of which it is made**. Commodity money consists of objects having value or use in themselves (intrinsic value) as well as their value in buying goods.\n\n- Fiat Currency\n> Fiat money is a type of currency that is not backed by a commodity, such as gold or silver. It is typically designated by the issuing government to be legal tender. Throughout history, fiat money was quite rare until the 20th century, but there were some situations where banks or governments stopped honoring redeemability of demand notes or credit notes, usually temporarily. In modern times, fiat money is generally authorized by government regulation.\n\n- Central Bank Digital Currencies\n> A central bank digital currency (CBDC) (also called digital fiat currency or digital base money) is a digital currency issued by a central bank, rather than by a commercial bank. It is also a liability of the central bank and denominated in the sovereign currency, as is the case with physical banknotes and coins. Rather than a new currency, CBDC is a form of central bank electronic money that could be used by households and businesses to make payments. A report by the Bank for International Settlements states that, although the term \"central bank digital currency\" is not well-defined, \"it is envisioned by most to be a new form of central bank money that is different from balances in traditional reserve or settlement accounts.\".\n\n- Cryptocurrency\n> A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. It is a decentralized system for verifying that the parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries, such as banks, when funds are being transferred between two entities","id":"06ead1be7047ac72","x":-4840,"y":-840,"width":1040,"height":1320,"color":"5"},
