## Notes
### Fun Facts

 > The project's intentionally oblique [[CIA]] cryptonym is made up of the diagraph MK, meaning that the project was sponsored by the agency's Technical Services Division, followed by the word ULTRA (which had previously been used to designate the most secret classification of World War ll intelligence). Other related cryptonyms include MK-NAOMI and MK-DELTA.

 > diagraph (noun)
 > - From Greek *diagraphein* - to mark out by lines

## Overview

 > Project MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA, was the code name for a covert [[CIA]] mind-control and chemical interrogation research program, run by the [[Office of Scientific Intelligence]]. This official U.S. government program began in the early 1950s, continuing at least through the late 1960s, and it supposedly used United States citizens as unwitting test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MK-ULTRA involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as other methods, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function.

## History
### MK-ULTRA Approved

> (April 15th, 1953)

> Succeeded [[Project Artichoke]].

> [[Sidney Gottlieb]] hatched a new idea that consumed [[Project Artichoke]] and gave him authority over all [[CIA]] research into mind control, including the ability to test drugs on witting and unwitting Americans, which was not being done under [[Project Artichoke]]. [[Sidney Gottlieb|Gottlieb]] and [[Richard Helms]], then-Chief of Operations for Directorate of Plans, wrote a memorandum to send to [[Allen Dulles]].

 > Largely in response to Chinese, Soviet, and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. The [[CIA]] wanted to use similar methods on their own captives.
>
 > The [[CIA]] was also interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders with such techniques, and would later invent several schemes to drug [[Fidel Castro]].

### MK-ULTRA Subprojects
#### Operation Midnight Climax

> (1954)

> Operation Midnight Climax was an operation carried out by the [[CIA]] as a sub-project of Project MKUltra.

> It was initially established in 1954 by [[Sidney Gottlieb]] and placed under the direction of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Boston, Massachusetts with the "Federal Narcotics Agent and CIA consultant" [[George Hunter White]] under the pseudonym of Morgan Hall.

 > [[Sidney Gottlieb]] based his plan for Project MK-Ultra and Operation Midnight Climax off of interrogation method research under [[Project Artichoke]]. Unlike [[Project Artichoke]], Operation Midnight Climax gave [[Sidney Gottlieb|Gottlieb]] permission to test drugs on unknowing citizens, which made way for the legacy of this operation. Hundreds of federal agents, field operatives, and scientists worked on these programs before they were shut down in the 1960s.

#### Cornell Experiments
##### Human Ecology Fund

> (1955 - 1965)

> Experiments took place at the site of the Human Ecology Fund.

> [[Harold Wolff]] was a neurologist whose research focused on migraines and headaches. [[Harold Wolff|Wolff]] met [[Allen Dulles]] while treating [[Allen Dulles|Dulles]]' son for a brain injury. He was later recruited by [[Allen Dulles|Dulles]] to direct a [[CIA]]-funded research program on persuasion and interrogation, using the [[Human Ecology Fund ]] as a front.

> [[Harold Wolff]] was joined by [[Lawrence Hinkle]], who focused on environmental impact on cardiovascular health.

> Was a funding front for the [[CIA]]

#### Harvard Experiments

> (1959 - 1962)

 > [[Ted Kaczynski (Unabomber)]] was an unwitting participant in an Harvard experiment led by [[Henry Murray]] where he was subject to constant demoralization and verbal abuse. Their conversations and physiological responses during abuse were monitored and

> One of these researchers, summarized the process later, "Each student had spent approximately 200 hours in the research, and had provided hundreds of pages of information about himself, his beliefs, his past life, his family, his college life and development, his fantasies, his hopes and dreams."

> "I remember appearing one afternoon for a 'debate' and being hooked up to electrodes and sat in a chair with bright lights and being told a movie was being made... I remember him attacking me, even insulting me, for my values, or for opinions I had expressed in my written material... I remember being shocked by the severity of the attack, and I remember feeling helpless to respond... What is the point of this? They have deceived me, telling me there was going to be a discussion, when in fact there was an attack."

#### Oklahoma Experiments
##### Subproject 43

> It was here that our good buddy [[Louis Jolyon West|Jolly West]], then the Chairman of Psychiatry at the [[University of Oklahoma]],  was contracted by the [[CIA]] for MK-ULTRA Subproject 43, which the [[CIA]] funded with a 20,800 USD grant.

> ![[Louis Jolyon West#^1227bf]]
##### Electric Elephant Acid Test

> (1962)

 > "Tusko's Last Trip"

> You already know your boy [[Louis Jolyon West|Jolly West]] was all up in here.

> They gave an elephant so many drugs that he fucking died.

### Destruction of MK-ULTRA Files

> (1973)

 > [[CIA]] director [[Richard Helms]] orders all MK-ULTRA files destroyed.

### MK-ULTRA is Publicly Known

> (1975)

> Project MK-ULTRA was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by the U.S. Congress, through investigations by the [[The Church Committee]], and by a presidential commission known as the [[Rockefeller Commission]].

> [[The Church Committee]] and [[Rockefeller Commission]] investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helmsâ€™ destruction order.

### MK-ULTRA Covered Up

> (1977)

>  In an interview, 14-year [[CIA]] veteran [[Victor Marchetti]] specifically called the [[CIA]] claim that MK-ULTRA was abandoned a "cover story. "
