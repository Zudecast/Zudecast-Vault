> Operated by the [[CIA]]'s [[Office of Scientific Intelligence]].

> The primary goal of Project Artichoke was to determine whether a person could be involuntarily made to perform an act of attempted assassination. The project also studied the effects of isolation, hypnosis, forced addiction to (and subsequent withdrawal from) morphine, and other chemicals, including LSD, to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects.

> Project Artichoke originally began as Project BLUEBIRD. On August 20, 1951, [[Allen Dulles]] ordered BLUEBIRD to be expanded and centralized, and renamed it to [[Project Artichoke]], which quickly became a power base for [[Sidney Gottlieb]]. Dulles was promoted to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence days after intensifying [[Project Artichoke]]'s scale. This assured protection and encouragement for all of [[Sidney Gottlieb]]'s future mind-control projects from the highest levels of the U.S. government.

> Experimented with "Special Interrogation" techniques on captured prisoners overseas at black sites like Camp King, Fort Clayton, and Villa Schuster, using drugs to attempt to break their ego control and elicit information.
