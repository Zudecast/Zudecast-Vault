## Notes
The Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency was the organization directly responsible for [[Operation Paperclip]], an OSS and Army CIC program for recruiting German scientists for U.S. government employment, primarily from 1945 to 1959. Many were former members and some were former leaders of the Nazi Party. The JIOA was established in 1945 as a subcommittee of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee]] (JIC) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Armed Forces. The JIOA comprised one representative from each member agency of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee]], and an operational staff of military intelligence officers from each military service.
