> The Church Committee (formally the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities) was a US Senate select committee in 1975 that investigated abuses by the [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency]] ([[CIA]]), [[NSA]] ([[NSA|NSA]]), [[FBI]] ([[FBI|FBI]]), and the [[IRS]] ([[IRS|IRS]]). Chaired by Idaho Senator [[Frank Church]] (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the "Year of Intelligence", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential [[Rockefeller Commission]]. The committee's efforts led to the establishment of the permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
